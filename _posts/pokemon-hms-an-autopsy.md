HMs are a genuinely brilliant design choice. Most JRPGs have a very clear line between exploration and combat, especially at the time Pokémon was originally released. But Pokémon was serious about adding some fun exploration elements to the overworld. It's kind of like a minimal version of a Metroid or Zelda game in that respect. You explore the world, you get tools that let you interact with the world in new ways, and then you explore even more. It's fun!

The very clever thing is that you teach _your Pokémon_ the skills that allow you to explore the world. And the skills are combat abilities, so your exploration tools interact with combat. It really emphasizes that your Pokémon are more than just things you send out to battle -- they're companions that explore the world together with you! What a nice idea!

Mechanically, this also plays to Pokémon's strengths. One thing the games are excellent at getting the player to regularly consider making changes to their party. HMs play into that, because not every Pokémon can learn every HM! It's easy to go through half the game without having a flying type Pokémon on your team without even noticing it -- but as soon as you get the extremely useful Fly HM, it becomes very attractive to give some flyer a permanent spot in your party.

That's why everyone loves HMs, and no one has ever complained about them!

---
Just kidding! The fans' complaints about HMs grew steadily louder over time, and Game Freak either capitulated or agreed with fans' perspective. At first, new HMs were being added every generation, but the swelling complaints had clearly reached a critical point before the release of Generation V (_Pokémon Black_ and _White_). Gen V was not only the first generation to _not add_ a new HM, it was also the first generation _remove_ an HM without replacing it with another -- and it removed two! Generation VI (_Pokémon X_ and _Y_) was the last generation to feature HMs at all.

HMs have been a thing of the past for three whole generations, now. If HMs have been non-existent for fully a third of the Pokémon franchise's life, could it be that they were never any good to begin with? What was it that people didn't like about them?

There are actually several major problems, each of which compound on each other:

1. HMs took up too many move slots
2. HMs are hard to unlearn
3. Most HMs are weak combat options

The answer is simple, and to many of you its probably so obvious that you're sick of me talking around it. As I mentioned before, HMs take up a slot of your Pokémon's combat moves. But, with only four slots available for each Pokémon, you don't have many to spare. A full team of 6 Pokémon has 24 total move slots. _Pokémon Red_ and _Blue_ had 5 total HMs. To have all HMs available at all times, you would need to tie up 5 out of 24, or a little over one-fifth, of your total available move slots. By Gen IV (_Pokémon Diamond_ and _Pearl_), there were **8** HMs, requiring **a full third of your party's combat slots!**

Further, HMs, once learned, cannot be easily unlearned. This is a necessary evil to prevent a player entering an area using an HM move, unlearning that move, and then being unable to get back. They can only be removed at one specific location in each generation, which is always found rather late in the game -- around badge #6 at the earliest. So, once you commit to an HM, you're stuck with it for likely a long time. In Gen I, you're stuck with it forever.

Both of these problems are compounded by the simple fact that _most HMs are terrible as combat moves._ Let's start by taking a look at Gen I's HMs, where this problem was the least bad:

![[Pasted image 20241116105838.png]]

Taking these in order:

1. <abbr title="Normal type. Power 40. Accuracy 95">**Cut:**</abbr> This is acquired early in the game, but even by the time it's acquired you have several better normal type options -- like <abbr title="Normal type. Power 80. Accuracy 85">Mega Punch</abbr>, which the player got by TM a badge and a half prior. Even most weaker Normal moves have some additional effect that usually makes them a better option. For example, <abbr title="Normal type. Power 40. Accuracy 100">Quick Attack</abbr>, which the player has had on their Rattata and/or Pidgey before they left Route 1, is probably the better option -- unless you _like_ missing your attacks, that is.
2. <abbr title="Flying type. Power 90. Accuracy 95.">**Fly:**</abbr> Perhaps the best flying type move in the game, behind only <abbr title="Flying type. Power 80. Accuracy 100">drill peck</abbr>. The overworld utility of this makes it a must-have.
3. <abbr title="Water type. Power 90. Accuracy 100.">**Surf:**</abbr> The best water type move in the game, and will keep that distinguished position for several more generations.
4. <abbr title="Normal type. Power 80. Accuracy 100">**Strength:**</abbr> A better option than Cut! But that's about all that can be said for it. <abbr title="Normal type. Power 85. Accuracy 100. 30% paralyze chance.">Body Slam</abbr> is strictly better (but then again, Body Slam is fantastic), but once again this HM is not clearly better than other, very common, slightly weaker moves with useful secondary effects.
5. <abbr title="Normal type. 100% Accuracy. Reduces opponent's accuracy.">**Flash:**</abbr> The bane of every eight year old. _No one_ wants to put an accuracy reducing move on their team. The one silver lining of this move is, ironically, that it also has very little overworld use -- only Rock Tunnel makes use of this HM, after which you can box the poor sacrificial lamb that learned this move forever and never have to think about it again.

2 of these are the best moves of their respective type. The other 3 are bad options even by the time you get them. Future generations _had a worse ratio than this._ This is as good as it gets!

But here's where things get interesting. This problem is the least bad in Gen I for more reasons than just the ratio of good HM moves to bad ones. The other mitigating factor is that _Gen I move slots were less valuable, because there were fewer good moves._

Say, for example, you want to use Flash to get through Rock Tunnel. You're gonna have to sacrifice a move slot for a basically worthless move. But who can afford to only have _three_ move slots for the rest of the game? Well, basically everyone. Let's look at Pikachu's learnset, for example:

![[Pasted image 20241116115540.png]]

At the end of this little guy's career, he will have:
1. An electric attacking move (Thunder Bolt by TM or Thunder otherwise)
2. Thunder Wave
3. A Normal type attacking move (either Quick Attack or Swift)
4. Uh.... Agility? Growl?
It's hard to find a good use for that fourth move slot. That means the _opportunity cost_ of sealing one slot away forever with basically an empty space is quite low.

It may seem unfair to pick an Electric type, since they have famously small move pools. Ok! Let's pick something more charitable. How about... the most famous starter Pokémon of all time, Charizard?

![[Pasted image 20241116120155.png]]
(Note that there's nothing Charizard learns from a prior evolution -- this is his entire evolutionary line's level up move set).

Throughout all of Charizard's life, it will essentially learn two types of moves: Normal type attacking moves, and Fire type attacking moves. It will also learn some bad stat changing moves. Utilizing all the TMs available, it could also add a Ground type attacking move (Earthquake), a Fighting type attacking move (Submission), and some debatably useful support moves (Rest, Swords Dance). Stretching our TMs to the absolute limit still only gives us about 6 viable choices for our beloved starter -- and for most of these TMs, any one we use on Charizard is one we can't use anywhere else. If you give Charizard Earthquake, that may round him out a bit, but it means Nidoking and Nidoqueen can't _ever_ learn Earthquake! 

6 is still more than 4, so it's definitely possible to fill out all four move slots! But in company like this, we're not exactly missing out on much if we use a slot on Strength. Frankly, if we threw Cut onto Charmeleon in the early game, it wouldn't be that great of a loss. We just don't have that many ways to get all 4 move slots to put in work for us, so throwing one away on even 5 of your 6 Pokémon is just not that great a cost.

This is in stark contrast to future generations. As the generations went on, _Pokémon_ combat got better and better. Part of the reason for this is that there are many more moves, and many more _good_ moves. By as early as Gen IV, not only was it easy to fill out all 4 of any given Pokémon's move slots, it was consistently difficult to choose which moves to keep! In an environment where each move slot has so many good options, even 5 HMs would have felt oppressive. 8 HMs? That's just asking way too much.
